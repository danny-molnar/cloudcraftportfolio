# CloudCraftPortfolio

## Overview

Welcome to my `CloudCraftPortfolio` – a comprehensive showcase of my expertise in cloud engineering, software development, and data analytics. As a mid-level cloud engineer with experience in AWS, GCP, Terraform, Ansible, and a passion for data analytics and machine learning, this repository serves as a testament to my technical capabilities and project management skills.

Each project within this portfolio is designed to demonstrate a unique aspect of my professional skill set, ranging from cloud infrastructure automation to full-stack development and data processing. This monorepo approach allows for a cohesive view of various technologies and methodologies I am proficient in.
